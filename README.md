# I am Jakoby

..and this last year I  won Hak5's Hacker of the Year Award for the contributions I made to their payload gallery


The prize for this was a **$2000 Hak5 GiftCard** 

After winning I immedietely contacted Darren and asked to have it split into `20` - `$100` giftcards instead so I can give them away

I don't know what it is, my favorite thing in the entire world is giving stuff away. It makes me feel like I deserve to be here.
